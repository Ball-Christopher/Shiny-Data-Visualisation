<h2>Children and youth at higher risk of poor outcomes</h2>

<p>This work is part of the Treasury’s commitment to higher living standards and to an inclusive society where all New Zealanders 
can participate. The tool provides information about New Zealand children (aged 0 to 14) and youth (aged 15 to 24) 
at higher risk of poor future outcomes. </p>

<h3>What does the tool do?</h3>

<p>The Social Investment Insights tool tells us about children and youth living in different areas of New Zealand, and can be used to help inform timelier and better targeted services:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maps can be generated for the whole of New Zealand, or for specific regions.</li>
<li>Data can be presented at a broad level, or at a level as detailed as area unit (the equivalent of a city suburb).</li>
<li>Specific age groups can be presented and risk groups specific to that age group mapped.</li>
<li>Map data can be downloaded for later use.
Maps are presented alongside other information that describes the children and young people at higher risk of poor outcomes in that area, what this means in terms of their future outcomes, and some of the associated costs to government.</li>
</ul>

<h3>About the data used</h3>

<p>The study uses the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI), which was developed and is 
maintained by Statistics New Zealand. The data is held in a secure environment, and 
made available to researchers under strict conditions. The IDI includes a wide range of 
survey and administrative data from across government agencies. The analysis was undertaken 
by the Treasury, working with other agencies.</p>

<h3>What does the analysis show us?</h3>

<p>This analysis tells us about children aged 14 and under, and youth aged 15 to 24, 
who are at higher risk of poor outcomes later in life. It identifies indicators 
that are associated with higher risk of poor future outcomes, shows the likelihood of 
these outcomes occurring, and identifies some of the costs associated with these outcomes.</p>

<h3>Children at risk - Four key risk indicators</h3>

<p>Using the information already collected by government agencies we can identify four indicators 
that are associated with having poor outcomes later in life. These are:</p>

<ol>
<li>    Having a CYF finding of abuse or neglect (8% of children). </li>
<li>    Being mostly supported by benefits since birth (15% of children). </li>
<li>    Having a parent with a prison or community sentence (17% of children). </li>
<li>    Having a mother with no formal qualifications (10% of children). </li>
</ol>

<p>Children who have these indicators are more likely to leave school with no qualifications, to spend 
time on benefit and out of work, and to end up in the justice system.  The greater the number of indicators 
a child has, the more likely this will happen. Children aged 0 to 5 and aged 6 to 14 are represented separately, 
according to whether they have two or more risk factors, three or more risk factors, or all four risk factors.</p>

<h3>Youth at risk - Ten target populations</h3>

<p>As children get older the information we have about them gets richer and more complex. As such, it’s not 
possible to pick a few risk factors that predict poor outcomes as we did for children. A richer picture 
helps us to make predictions, but also adds complexity. For this reason we developed a more sophisticated 
way to identify those youth most at risk of poor outcomes. We identified ten groups, or target 
populations – five at ages 15 to 19, and five at ages 20 to 24.</p>

<p><b> 15 to 19 year olds </b></p>

<ul>
<li>Teenage boys with Youth Justice or Corrections history</li>
<li>Teenagers with health, disability issues or special needs</li>
<li>Teenage girls supported by benefits</li>
<li>Mental health service users with stand-down or CYF history</li>
<li>Experienced significant childhood disadvantage</li>
</ul>

<p><b> 20 to 24 year olds </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Young offenders with custodial sentence</li>
<li>Young offenders with community sentence and CYF history</li>
<li>Jobseekers in poor health with CYF history</li>
<li>Sole parents not in fulltime employment with CYF history</li>
<li>Long-term disability beneficiaries</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using the tool</h3>

<p>A number of ‘pull-down menus’ can be used to change the map, focussing in on particular areas or risk groups. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sex: Male, Female, Total</li>
<li>Age Group: 00-05, 06-14, 15-19, 20-24</li>
<li>Risk Type: Changes with the age group selected, as above.</li>
<li>Geographic Viewing Unit: Allows you to choose to focus on a particular region or territorial authority.</li>
<li>Selected Region/Territorial Authority (depending on selection above).</li>
<li>Geographic Detail Displayed: Allows you to modify the level of geographical detail displayed.</li>
</ul>
